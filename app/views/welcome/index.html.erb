	<h2> What's this all about? </h2>
	<br>

	<h5> The Mood-O-Meter app makes it easy for you to record exactly how you feel and what actions contributed to your state-of-mind from your morning routine to your daily workload all the way to your evening commute home. By recording your mood on a regular basis you give yourself the opportunity to improve your quality of life in a free and easy way.  </h5>

	<h2> How this works: </h2>
		<br>
	<p> 1. Fill out a short checklist to identify daily activities and their correlation to your daily mood. </p>
	<br>
	<p> 2. On a scale of 1-10 rate your degree of happines for the day. Make sure to consider your whole day and not just a fleeting emotion, this will help to increase the accuracy of your the correlations we draw between your activities and your mood.</p>
	<br>
	<p> 3. Write a short entry that personalizes your current mood. When you check out your responses over the course of a few weeks this information will allow you to more accurately reflect on how and why you feel the way you do. </p>
